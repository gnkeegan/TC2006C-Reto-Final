### Project Description



This is the final submission of our team project: COVID-19 Segmentation. Here we train a model using the U-Net architecture due to its effectiveness in the medical field.





### Documentation Notes



The project's documentation is found within our notebook.



We ran out of GPU time on Kaggle, so version 13 is the most recent trained run. Subsequent versions only include documentation updates; the ETL and model code were not modified.

See version 13 for the latest training and test results at detail. We are currently running the most recent version.

### Corrections



Over the course of our project, we were given a series of corrections for our final submission:



⦁	Data analysis and ETL were carried out.



⦁	The model was configured based on the original U-Net.



⦁	Graphs with the results were generated.



⦁	The hyperparameters of our original implementation were modified to improve our model’s performance.



⦁	A new DeepLabV3 model was added to compare the results with our model.



⦁	The documentation of the report included in the Kaggle notebook was improved.
